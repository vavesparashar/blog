When HubSpot launched the CRM(product) for companies between 100-1000 employees, their marketing strategy was to educate the buyer.

Teaching the buyer nuances of digital ecosystem and pushing them along the sales funnel which had a cycle up to 18 months, the idea was to target users who can potentially be their clients. This simple teach approach would go on to establish the company as an industry benchmark as HubSpot academy and more importantly  a unicorn in next few years.

Such was the success of *teach* approach that many other companies followed the same principle. 

You educate the buyer, they become your fan and spread the word around. 

Many would recommend the product everywhere from Facebook groups to reddit marketing channels. Eventually the company becomes industry leader as nothing beats word-of-mouth press. 

However *teach* approach seems to be last decade marketing tactic. Reason being marketing becomes saturated when everyone is following the same thing. 

Also, people realize that everyone is pretending to be a *guru* and trust cannot be given so freely. 

## Product-led Marketing

With new-age companies like Notion & Zoom product-led growth is becoming the norm. As marketing is always adapting, We are transitioning from *teach* approach to *learn* approach under product-led growth. 

As the name states, The product leads the way. 

**You focus on the Users** than the buyers. 

Sales funnel stages in acquisition, expansion, conversion, retention are lead by the product. 

Marketing caters to the existing users as the focus is on users upgrading existing services and metrics like revenue per user take primary importance.

Let us try to understand this using a popular example: Notion.so

Notion's product is so versatile that its users have been the biggest channel for growth. Majority of users kept raving about new features among their social circle. Features like *share to web*  and linking to a domain became viral among the tech community.

A simple breakdown can be:

1. Notion product is perceived by the user as being a unique “highest-value-product” that they want to use regularly
2. The user realizes significant ongoing value quickly and easily with little-to-no help from company personnel.
3. The product “paywalls” follow, rather than lead, the actual value that the user receives and pricing scales as usage increases and more value is delivered.
4. Notion has features that allow the product to market, sell and onboard new users.
5. Marketing aims to engage users with the product rather than engaging buyers with a sales team.

My focus is to decipher it from a marketing perspective. 

Marketing takes the form of helping the user to learn the product, use it's feature so that user feels empowered. If done correctly, chances are the user will become a fan.

Traditionally core metric in marketing and sales has always being making sales. Due to pressure on executives, often this led to practices like hard sell. In internet era, buyers are aware. 

In fact, with the way modern society has evolved, it is primary that user don't feel they are being sold. It has a negative effect esp. if your core audience is Gen Y and Gen X. 

So, *Learn* approach seems fitting with the above idea. You aim to help the user learn the product and how it will solve the pain points. 

## Marketing Strategy

A few basic questions before setting up a marketing campaign are:

- Who is buying your product?
- Where will they find out about your product?
- Why are they buying your product?
- How are they buying your product?

Let’s take a look at how *Product-led* marketing approach answers these questions:

- Who is buying your product?

You sell to *users* not *buyers*.

Focus is on inbound growth. A cost efficient and relatively easy sell compared to new user acquisition, where both the cost of acquiring new customers and time to make a sale is higher. 

- Where will they find out about your product?‍

Word of mouth leads the way. More specifically, happy users will share your product with friends and coworkers. 

As former Slack CMO Bill Macaitis states "I tell my team members that their gold standard is not whether customers bought a product, but did they recommend us?"

- Why are they buying your product?‍

Your product should be trustworthy, deliver value, and have better UX than your competitors.

Product is the center around which you build everything up. You need a product that is simple to use and gets the job done. 

- How are they buying your product?‍

Users should become buyers within the product itself—or at least after experiencing the product first-hand—rather than via sales reps.

## Monetization

Generally but not always, **freemium model** leads the way which allows users to experience the product without going through a sales or marketing team.

**The product “paywall” follow, rather than lead.** 

As per the need of the user, pricing scales and more value is delivered.

Let us try to understand via a simple example: [Carrd.co](http://carrd.co) A landing page builder. 

- Free service up to 3 landing pages. [Freemium model]
- If you want to remove carrd branding on free service, you upgrade to lite package. [Paywall follows]
- If you want to embed forms, you further upgrade to standard package. [Increasing revenue per user]

A user never feels compelled but can always scale as per his/her requirement. 

A *learn* approach focuses on the existing audience and increasing revenue per user. One of the many reasons why building an audience is go-to advise. One can always launch a service or a product around the audience. 

## Conclusion

Learn approach is the next evolution of inbound marketing when rather than teaching buyers, you make the users learn. 

It is an efficient way to increase your revenue, win loyalty and scale your business. 

But, by its very nature, a learn approach is only as successful as the underlying product. Companies aim to build truly stellar products that put the user, not the buyer, front and center. 

Most importantly, learn approach simplify and streamline everything from the actual product to its marketing, sales and pricing all in an effort to make onboarding new users as clear and as seamless as possible.

The neo-marketing approach seems to be gaining prevalence across the tech industry. Early adopters will have advantage. Much like it is with time, This approach will become saturated as well, so enjoy the ride as long as you can.

Until next time,
