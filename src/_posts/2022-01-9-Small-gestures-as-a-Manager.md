As you grow in Marketing career, It is only progressive if you become a team lead as a manager or upper hierarchy employee where managing humans become part of job as well.

There are many aspects to leading a team and this post is mainly about keep the team motivated enough that they give that little extra and always be a positive ray of hope rather than a sulky worker.

While as a manager you cannot control personal problems of team members but you can create an environment where everyone is at ease and performing their best.

One of those actions are rewarding the members of team by employee of the month. It is great to reward hard working employee who feels appreciated and other get motivated as well. A trophy with a certificate does the job most often than not. While any financial rewards for the same goes a long way motivating others.
