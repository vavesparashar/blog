I have been trying to set up whiteseer.com

I am using git + netlify free hosting to set things up. It has been laborious. 

Just getting the raw code, is not enough. You need to customize the website as per your needs. As you dig deep, you realise the developer has done some good work but just finding those details and making the right changes takes times. 

Still, it is lot of work.

1. Deciding logo

2. Brand color

3. Who are we?

4. domain

5. email marketing services

   and so on..

Just took break from undo-ing an error i made over git and it is 1am in the night. Enjoying good music though. :)
