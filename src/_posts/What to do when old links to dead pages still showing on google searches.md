 **Is it better to market on popular social media platforms as much as possible or focus more on high quality post?**

I use the 3 layered social approach

- Star

- Standard

- Hygiene

**Star** is your top high quality content which you'd post once or twice a week at peak times.

**Standard** is your good but not great content that gets engagement you should be posting 3 times a week.

**Hygiene** is your daily content that just serves to keep traction and minimal brand awareness.

Don't try to make every post a god level post. Not every post has to be amazing!
