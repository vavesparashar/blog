**Solution:**  301 redirect them to the most relevant existing pages.

The 301 redirect is sending users to a different page. The best case is you have similar pages on the new site you can direct users too. If you donâ€™t, you can redirect to the homepage.

301 redirect them to a page that's related to the old page, if there is nothing you can point them to serve a 410 to let Google know the page was removed. 

You should also update your sitemap and submit to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster tool. 

Also, Next time you do a redesign make 301 redirects a part of your planning process. :)
