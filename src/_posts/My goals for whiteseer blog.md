* Great thoughts by different humans in history.

* Debate, comment and thoughts on the topic. 

This is the entire plan of whiteseer. I wanted to read works of a few past geniuses. However, until I had the opportunity to monetize the platform, it was difficult project to pursue. 

So, I decided to setup the blog and i will grow from there. 

Once this habit kicks in, I plan to add a newsletter. Sending a daily email about a powerful quote to add some positivity in their lives. 

After 2 weeks of newsletter publish, I will launch instagram for whiteseer. Strategy will be shared soon. 

Once instagram is setup and 1000 followers+subscribers are reached, launch a podcast. 

**Monetization strategy**

Donations and sponsorships.

I want to do the work. I would be happy if the project can be sustainable.
