Giving your best is almost like a second nature. Never compromising becomes an attitude if desire to succeed is strong. But often in order for being the best, we lose track of time.

There will always be clients who would want free knowledge. Restrict it. There are two reason for the same,

1. Anything distributed for free, won't get the value it deserves.

2. This kills the time and energy and most of the time, clients hardly upgrades.

It has to be mentioned, this keeps the client's desire to checkout other agency's work at bay but keep it very much time bounded and discuss the agenda, time frame earlier over email. This will ensure that **time** is saved, not too much **energy** is wasted and last but not the least, the **value** keeps adding up.
