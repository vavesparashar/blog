Recently google announced that, [Google Ads are offering $340 Million in Ad Credit to Small Businesses](https://www-cnbc-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/03/27/google-offering-800m-coronavirus-help-package.html).

There is a catch though:

1) Only valid for users with an active Google Ads account at the beginning of 2019.
2) You can't apply, they'll email you to let you know of the credit.

This comes in backdrop of Coronavirus pandemic which has resulted in free fall of economies around the world. Many say this is a noble push from a one of the big 5 tech companies but let's not lose sight of that fact this is a business move, not altruism.

Google has been losing serious marketshare to Facebook and just recently they reported lower earnings in their ad division, which as you know comprises the bulk of their revenue at this point.

This is nothing more than a thinly disguised "win back" campaign, because don't ever forget the company that ran under the "Don't be evil" motto long ago went back on their words. Google Ads is an auction system. That means adding bidders with free credits can drive up the prices for their paying clients. Itâ€™s keeping the costs up of the other ads that would have disappeared. Free credits might even push the price.

**5 years ago Google was what FB is now, a dominant leader that didn't need to offer discounts.**

At one point FB was handing out $400 for free to advertise on their network.

Google just laughed, pulled their $100 credit, making it $100 on $25 spend (only for new accounts).
You know what they say about absolute power, and Google had it.

Now they're forced to come crawling back on their knees to appease shareholders and attempt to recapture that marketshare.

Will Facebook be next? [Tweet](https://twitter.com/Mktngbaba) to let me know.
