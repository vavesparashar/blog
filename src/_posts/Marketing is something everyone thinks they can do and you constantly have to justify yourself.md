>  Marketing is something everyone thinks they can do and you constantly have to justify yourself. 

This one describes pretty well how marketing is perceived.

Marketing is a job that literally everyone thinks they can do so a marketing professional constantly have to "justify" yourself and your job. So annoying, and laughable when a non-marketing professional takes a wack at it. 

I always had the feeling that lack of any hard skills compared to other job groups (e.g. technical, finance, etc.) may be what causes this. 

A good **solution** to above can be:

- Invest in learning tools like google analytics
- Once basics of marketing are clear, you can transition towards data and analytics via tools like tableau 

While still it doesn't solve the main perception around marketing but learning new tool defiantly gives a sense of security and confidence.
